# census-income-
A census income machine learning project

open `final_census_income_project-checkpoint.ipynb` plz


for the row data file, I convert it into csv for me easy to read in jupyter notebook
The csv files(`adults.csv` and `test.csv`)  has been uploaded

The `adult_income_machine_learning-checkpoint.ipynb` is a draft version, without the test.data

I found I lost one data file to analyze after I finish `adult_income_machine_learning-checkpoint.ipynb`

So that I do it again in `final_census_income_project-checkpoint.ipynb`
